Steve Banks defines startup as "a temporary organization used to search for a repeatable and scalable business model". According to this definition, it is clear as day that the Agile mode of development should be chosen for the SDLC.

My plans would encompass the usual model of development wrapped around the scope of a T-shirt manufacturing company as follows:

1. Elicitation
		a. Meetup / JAD Sessions
		b. Understanding Workflow
		c. Mock Order
2. Analysis
	a. System Analysis
3. Design
	a. System Design
4. Development
	a. Coding
	b. Testing
		i. 	Pilot
		ii. Usability
5. Deployment
6. Maintainance

The aforementioned project guideline will enable the project to complete in feasible time.
